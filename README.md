## Yatzy Solver
This is a program that will try to find the optimal moves in a game of Scandinavian Yatzy.  

## Initial Idea
- You get an input -> you check which combinations are already satisfied. 
- The probability to achieve each outcome is calculated. 
- A choice needs to be made based on the probabilities. 

## The Evaluation
- I have just begun working on the actual function that will decide the best move. So far to me it feels very inelegant and klunky, might have to choose some better approach.
